# Car-Web-App
Project to create a drop-down to list a car's information for my Web App Development Course

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirments were to create:

A car part has a name etc. and belongs to many cars.

A car make has a name and a country.

Cars have make and model names, VIN numbers, and many parts.

You will need to create a CarsParts model or scaffold.

In the form for a car, have a drop-down with a list of possible parts to be added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specs used for the project:
- Ruby 2.5
- Rails 5.2.3
- Jetbrains Rubymine 2019.2.2

Rubymine autogenerated the scaffolds and models. I adjusted the code to meet following requirements:
- Car has a many-to-many relationship with Part
- Car has a one-to-one relationship with Make
- Tested it by running a server and using the functions; fixed errors as I came across them
